      <h2>How to Perfectly Sear a Steak</h2>
      <p>Searing is one of the most important techniques in cooking meat. It creates a flavorful crust through the Maillard reaction.</p>
      
      <h3>The Science Behind Searing</h3>
      <p>When meat reaches about 300°F (150°C), the proteins and sugars on its surface undergo the Maillard reaction, creating hundreds of new flavor compounds. This is what gives seared meat its rich, complex flavor.</p>
      
      <h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Steak:</strong> Pat it completely dry with paper towels. Moisture prevents browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Season Well:</strong> Use salt and pepper generously. Season just before searing.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat Your Pan:</strong> Use a cast iron or stainless steel pan. Heat until it's smoking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Move It:</strong> Once the steak hits the pan, resist the urge to flip. Let it sit for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip Once:</strong> Flip only once and sear the other side for another 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Always rest your steak for 5 minutes before cutting to retain juices.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Temperature Guide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rare: 125°F (52°C)</li>
        <li>Medium Rare: 135°F (57°C)</li>
        <li>Medium: 145°F (63°C)</li>
        <li>Medium Well: 150°F (66°C)</li>
        <li>Well Done: 160°F+ (71°C+)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use a meat thermometer for perfect results every time. It removes the guesswork!</p>

      <h2>Knife Skills: Cuts Every Cook Should Know</h2>
      <p>Proper knife skills are fundamental to cooking. Not only do they make you faster, but they also ensure even cooking.</p>
      
      <h3>Essential Cuts</h3>
      
      <h4>Julienne</h4>
      <p>Thin, uniform sticks about 1/8 inch thick and 2-3 inches long. Perfect for stir-fries and salads.</p>
      
      <h4>Brunoise</h4>
      <p>Small, uniform cubes about 1/8 inch on each side. The finest dice used in professional cooking.</p>
      
      <h4>Chiffonade</h4>
      <p>Thin ribbon-like cuts made from leafy vegetables or herbs. Stack leaves, roll tightly, then slice.</p>
      
      <h4>Dice</h4>
      <p>Larger cubes typically 1/4 inch on each side. Used for soups, stews, and sauces.</p>
      
      <h4>Mince</h4>
      <p>Very small, fine pieces. Commonly used for garlic, ginger, and fresh herbs.</p>
      
      <h3>Knife Safety Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep your knife sharp - dull knives are more dangerous</li>
        <li>Use a proper grip: hold the knife firmly but not tensely</li>
        <li>Use the claw grip with your non-knife hand to protect your fingers</li>
        <li>Cut away from your body</li>
        <li>Use a cutting board that won't slip</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding Salt: The Baker's Secret</h2>
      <p>Salt is one of the most misunderstood ingredients in baking. It's not just for flavor - it has critical functions in dough development.</p>
      
      <h3>What Salt Does in Baking</h3>
      
      <h4>Strengthens Gluten</h4>
      <p>Salt tightens the gluten network, making dough more elastic and less sticky. This improves texture and structure.</p>
      
      <h4>Enhances Flavor</h4>
      <p>Salt amplifies other flavors in your bake. A small amount can make sweetness pop without tasting salty.</p>
      
      <h4>Controls Fermentation</h4>
      <p>In bread baking, salt slows yeast fermentation, giving better flavor development and structure.</p>
      
      <h4>Retains Moisture</h4>
      <p>Salt helps retain moisture in baked goods, keeping them fresher longer.</p>
      
      <h3>Types of Salt</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kosher Salt:</strong> Large crystals, less dense. Good for general baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Sea Salt:</strong> Contains trace minerals. Use fine varieties for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Table Salt:</strong> Very fine, denser. Use 25% less than kosher salt.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Standard Measurements</h3>
      <p>Most bread recipes use 1.5-2% salt by flour weight. This is about 1.5-2 teaspoons per 500g flour.</p>

      <h2>Emulsions: The Science of Sauces</h2>
      <p>An emulsion is a mixture of two liquids that normally don't mix - like oil and water. Understanding emulsions is key to making silky sauces.</p>
      
      <h3>How Emulsions Work</h3>
      <p>An emulsifier (like egg yolk or mustard) has molecules with one end that loves oil and one that loves water. These molecules arrange themselves to bind the two liquids together.</p>
      
      <h3>Classic Emulsified Sauces</h3>
      
      <h4>Hollandaise</h4>
      <p>A warm emulsion made with butter, egg yolks, and lemon juice. Essential for Eggs Benedict.</p>
      
      <h4>Mayonnaise</h4>
      <p>A cold emulsion made with oil and egg yolk. The foundation for countless variations.</p>
      
      <h4>Béarnaise</h4>
      <p>A hollandaise variation with shallots, tarragon, and white wine. Sophisticated and delicious.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Emulsions Break</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Temperature too high or too low</li>
        <li>Adding fat too quickly</li>
        <li>Wrong ratio of emulsifier to fat</li>
        <li>Ingredients too far apart in temperature</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>How to Fix a Broken Emulsion</h3>
      <p>Start with a fresh egg yolk in a clean bowl. Slowly whisk in the broken sauce drop by drop, just as you would when making it fresh. The emulsion should come back together.</p>
